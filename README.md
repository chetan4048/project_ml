ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System

This is a Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System that helps farmers choose the best crop based on soil and weather conditions. The model predicts the most suitable crop using parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall, and pH.

Features

âœ… Predicts the best crop for a given soil and weather condition
âœ… User-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
âœ… Backend powered by Flask and a trained ML model
âœ… Accepts Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall, and pH as input
âœ… Displays the recommended crop for the given inputs
